# custom-video-player
Basic custom video player with play, pause, stop and progress bar functionality

## Motivation

I wanted to test my ability to customise the standard HTML5 video element using CSS and control its behaviour via CSS. While there's nothing wrong with the default in many cases, this was a good exercise to see what can be altered and how.

## Tech used
HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks were harmed in the making of this project.

## Features
The video player has a toggling play/pause button, a stop button, a timestamp and a progress bar which is clickable to jump to other parts of the video

## Credits
I got inspired to build this after seeing [Brad Traversy's Custom Video Player from his Vanilla Web Projects](https://github.com/bradtraversy/vanillawebprojects/tree/master/custom-video-player), so I've been heavily influenced by that.

I looked at his code, recreated it exactly, wrote down the project specifications, and then created this mini web app from scratch based solely on those project specifications without looking at Brad's code. Any similarities are purely coincidental.
